Contains the python script for determining conservation level of a binding site

#####			CONSURF CONVERTER			#####
#####								#####
#####################################################################
### FIRST USE THE CONVERTER SCRIPT ON YOUR INPUT DATA -- FOLLOW THE STEPS BEFORE RUNNING
### SAVE THE ""RESULTS SUMMARY"" FROM CONSURF IN NORMAL TEXT FORMAT
### OPEN THE FILE IN A TEXT EDITOR AND CMD+F TO REPLACE A GOOFINESS REPLACE ", " with "," -- NOTE THE SPACE
### THE FIRST LINE FOR THE INPUT FOR THE CONVERTER SCRIPT SHOULD BE THE POS	SEQ	3LATOM ....
### REMOVE THE SECOND LINE IN THE FILE THAT ONLY CONTAINS "(normalized)" -- YOU CAN CHANGE THE "SCORE" TITLE TO SCOREN IF YOU LIKE
### DELETE ANY SPACES FROM THE TITLE NAMES
### FIRST TWO LINES SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:
 POS	 SEQ	    3LATOM	SCOREN		COLOR	CONFIDENCEINTERVAL	CONFIDENCEINTERVALCOLORS	MSADATA		RESIDUEVARIETY
   1	   P	 PRO1000:A	 1.452		  1	 0.211,3.276			    4,1			   7/300	P,K,A,I,C,L
### THE THREE LINES OF JUNK AT THE END OF THE FILE SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE TEXT FILE -- ONLY DATA!
### SO ... DELETE THESE LINES:
"*Below the confidence cut-off - The calculations for this site were performed on less than 6 non-gaped homologue sequences,"
"or the confidence interval for the estimated score is equal to- or larger than- 4 color grades."
### TO RUN THE CONVERTER: ./consurf_converter.sh [input file]
### AFTER YOU RUN THE CONVERTER THE CONVERTER PUT SOME DOUBLE QUOTES IN THE COLUMN TITLES -- GET RID OF THEM.

### THE SITEMAP SITES SHOULD BE ORDER IN ASCENDING ORDER -- i.e. SITE1 FIRST SITE5 LAST
### SCRIPT DOESN'T WORK IF THERE ARE LESS THAN 5 SITES IN THE SITEMAP INPUT FILE
### THE SCRIPT IS WRITTEN ASSUME THE SITES ARE IN CHAIN A; THEREFORE THE SITEMAP INPUT FILE SHOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS:

Chain A: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,26,29,33,81,84,85,88,89,90,91,102,105,106,109,110,113,156,159,160,164,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,183,187,190,191,193,194,197,198,200,201,202,204,205,209,210,250,254,257,258,260,261,262,264,265,268,271,272,274,275,276,278,280,281,282,284,285,286,288,289,292
